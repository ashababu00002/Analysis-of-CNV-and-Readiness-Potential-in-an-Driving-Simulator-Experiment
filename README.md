Analysis-of-CNV-and-Readiness-Potential-in-an-Driving-Simulator-Experiment

1. Abstract
Key Concepts:
  - Readiness Potential (RP) represents neural activity during movement preparation.
  - Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) is associated with task-specific preparatory states and stimulus perception.
  Objective:To analyze RP and CNV using EEG during a driving simulation, exploring motor and cognitive contributions to neural stimulus-preceding activity.
  Findings: RP and CNV occur within 1–2 seconds, with variability depending on task type and context.



2. Problem Analysis and Goals
Problem:
  - RP and CNV reflect distinct neural processes, requiring specific experimental setups for proper identification.
  Hypothesis: Scenarios designed for EEG recordings will reveal clear distinctions between RP and CNV.
  Goals: Process raw EEG data to visualize RP and CNV, generating graphs to analyze their relation to driving tasks.

3. Materials and Methods
   Participants:
  - Included a 24-year-old subject undergoing a driving simulation.
  EEG Setup:
  - 16-channel EEG system using the 10-20 electrode placement method.
  - High-pass filter set to 0.1 Hz and low-pass filter at 500 Hz.
  Driving Simulation Tasks:
    Task 1: Guided braking with auditory and visual cues.
    Task 2: Spontaneous braking without predefined cues.
  Data Collection:
  - EEG signals were recorded during both tasks, followed by spectral and temporal analyses.


4. Results
Experiment 1 (Task 1):
  - CNV and RP signals showed gradual negative potentials, consistent with preparatory neural activity.
  - RP amplitudes ranged from 20 µV to 30 µV before braking cues.
  - Power spectral analysis indicated stability and highlighted the timing of CNV within 1–2 seconds.
  Experiment 2 (Task 2):
  - Signals were less consistent due to lack of predefined cues.
  - CNV patterns showed greater variability and resembled sine waves when averaged.
  - Lower signal stability was observed in spectral analysis.


5. Discussion
- RP and CNV reflect preparatory and anticipatory neural mechanisms linked to motor and cognitive functions during driving.
- Experiment 1 confirmed that task-specific cues enhance RP and CNV clarity.
- In Task 2, the absence of cues led to interference, reducing the discernibility of RP and CNV.


6. Conclusion
- RP and CNV provide crucial insights into motor preparation and cognitive anticipation.
- These findings have potential applications in driver training, intelligent transportation systems, and safety measures.
- Further research could enhance EEG-based real-time monitoring in practical driving scenarios.


7. Future Directions
- Incorporate larger datasets and more participants.
- Expand experimental conditions to study broader behavioral responses.
- Investigate real-world driving applications, including autonomous vehicle interactions.
